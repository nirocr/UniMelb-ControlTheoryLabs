University of Melbourne Control Theory Labs

CC31 - INTRODUCTION TO LABVIEW & SIMPLE FEEDBACK.
By the end of this experiment students should develop a thorough understanding of: 
- how a PC can control an analogue system with awareness of sampling rate and both A/D, D/A conversion,
- the use of  LabVIEW to control and monitor a ‘DC Servo Motor’, &
- the effect sampling rate can have on the performance of a system.


CC32 - Digital Controller Design Using State Space Methods and LabVIEW
By the end of this experiment students should develop a thorough understanding of: 
- how to model a computer-controlled DC Servo Motor using a state-space description &
- using the model and full state feedback to achieve a desired closed loop response to an initial disturbance.
